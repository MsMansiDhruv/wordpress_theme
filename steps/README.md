WordPress Theme Building
===

Hi. This is a starter theme called 'Steps'.

Getting Started
---------------

If you want to keep it simple, just download the theme and run it like you would with any other theme. You just can edit the changes from the GUI panel itself.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to do: make an awesome WordPress website. :)

Good luck!
